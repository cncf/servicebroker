# Contributing

All contributors sending pull requests (PRs) must have a Contributor
License Agreement on file as either an
[individual](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/pdfs/CFF_Individual_CLA.pdf)
or via their
[employer](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/pdfs/CFF_Corporate_CLA.pdf).

All new Github issues and PRs will be reviewed by the Project Management
Committee (PMC) on the
[Weekly Call](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/wiki/Weekly-Call)
and will have a PMC member assigned to them who is responsible for following up
with the author and bringing the issue/PR to a resolution.

## Minor Changes

Minor change proposals to the specification, changes such as editorial bugs
or enhancements that do not modify the semantics of the specification or
syntax of the API, can be suggested via a Github issue or pull request (PR).

If there is a need for some discussion around how best to address the concern,
then opening an issue prior to doing the work to develop a PR would be best.
These minor issues do not need to follow the [Major Changes](#major-changes)
process described below, rather the issue should be used to come to a consensus
around a PR that will eventually be submitted. If the proposed change is
uncontroversial (e.g. a typo) then a PR can be submitted directly without
opening an issue. Either way, once a PR is submitted it will be reviewed per the
[process](#prissue-review-process) described below.

### Major Changes

Major changes will be tracked through a number of stages before becoming part of
the specification. The working group will use a set of pre-defined Github labels
to highlight the current stage of each proposal. Note that these labels will not be
used for [minor changes](#minor-changes).

New design proposals to the API spec should be submitted by opening a
Github issue with a link to a Google Doc containing the proposal. Proposals
should focus primarily on motivation, problem statement, and use cases before
suggesting a solution or change. Collaboration on the design, fleshing out of
use cases, etc can occur as comment discussions in the Google Doc, as well
as on our weekly calls. Once the working group have agreed to focus on a
proposal, it will move into the first stage, as described below.

The stages that a proposal will go through are as follows:
- `1 - reviewing proposal`:
  The API working group is actively reviewing a proposal that has been submitted
  as a Github issue with the aim of validating both the problem statements and
  any proposed solutions. Critical information such as new API endpoints and
  response codes should be reviewed at this stage. For changes largely impacting
  the Open Service Broker API actors (Platforms, Service Authors, etc), it is
  recommended to solicit feedback from these actors and leave enough time (say
  2 weeks) for feedback to be provided, and for the potentially received
  objections/suggestions to be handled.
  Once the design has been finalized in the Google Doc, the proposed set of
  changes to the specification should be made available for review. This could
  be done by pointing to a branch in a Github repo with the proposed edits or by
  creating a PR with the `do not merge` label assigned to it. Reviewers, or
  potential implementers of the feature, can then easily see the exact changes
  being proposed so that they can comment on them. If the proposal adds or
  changes an object model or resource endpoint definition, it is expected that
  the PR will also include the necessary updates to the
  [Open API document](openapi.yaml) and [Swagger document](swagger.yaml).
  Before moving to the next stage, consensus must be agreed on the weekly call
  that the proposal is ready to be validated.
- `2 - validating through implementation`:
  One or more platforms are actively working on the proposal with the aim of
  providing feedback on the end-to-end implementation of the proposed solution.
  The related issue and/or PR should be kept updated with any activity or
  feedback that is collected whilst the change is being implemented. It is
  expected that during this implementation phase there will be changes made to
  the design to accurately represent the current status of the proposal.
  Before moving to the next stage, this feedback must have been presented on the
  weekly call and any issues found during this stage must have been discussed
  with the group and the issue and/or PR should have been updated accordingly.
- `3 - reviewing PR`:
  Feedback has been received on the implementation of the proposed solution and
  a pull request has been created containing the validated specification
  changes. By this point, the API interactions should be well understood and
  there should be no technical surprises; we expect the only discussion
  necessary on PRs to be for wordsmithing and formatting. The PR will then be
  reviewed as described in the [process](#prissue-review-process) below.

Note that not all issues will need to go through the
`validation through implementation` stage, and proposals can move back to a
previous label at any time.

## PR/Issue Review Process

All proposals (either pull requests or issues) will follow the process
described below:

- All proposals must be available for review for no less than one week before
  they are approved. This will provide each dedicated committer enough time
  to review the proposal without unnecessarily delaying forward progress.
  Any non-trivial edit to the proposal (e.g. edits larger than typos) will
  reset the clock.
- Any dedicated committer can veto (via a "NOT LGTM" comment in the proposal).
  The comment must include the reasoning behind the veto.
  It is then expected that the dedicated committers will discuss the concerns
  and determine the next step for proposal - either close/reject the proposal
  or address the concerns raised such that the "NOT LGTM" can be rescinded.
- A proposal requires at least 3 "LGTM" comments from at least 3 different
  organizations to be approved.
- Once a "design change" issue is approved, it will be tagged with an
  "proposal finalized" label. This indicates that it is ready to be
  implemented by a platform developer, see the [process](#contributing) above.
- Once a pull request is approved, it will be merged into the 'master' branch
  and labels should be removed any related issues and PRs as necessary.
- If the pull request is significant enough to warrant noting a difference in
  compatibility between platforms, the feature should be noted in the table for
  [Platform Compatibility for OSBAPI](compatibility.md).

## Release Process

Any member of the PMC can request a specific SHA on master (the
**Release RC SHA**) is ready to be released into a new version of the spec. They
will do this by creating a new PR with the title of the proposed release. For
example, **"Release Proposal: v$major.$minor"**.

### Prepare a PR

1. In a fork, create a new branch called "v$major.$minor-rc" from the
  **Release RC SHA**.
2. Create a new commit titled `prepare release` with the following changes:
  * Update [release-notes.md](release-notes.md) detailing the changes that are
  to be released in this version. Include a versioned link to the new branch's
  version of the spec.
  * Update [README.md](README.md) with an updated _Latest Release_ subheading
  and links to the latest version of the documents (`spec.md`, `profile.md`,
  `openapi.yaml`, etc).
  * Update [spec.md](spec.md) with an updated _Changes Since v..._ section (and
  link from table of contents) containing a copy of the relevant release notes,
  and with any references to the previous version of the specification (i.e. the
  `X-Broker-API-Version` headers) updated. Do not update the header
  `Open Service Broker API (master - might contain changes that are not yet released)`
  (this will be done if and when the release proposal is approved).
  * Update [diagram.md](diagram.md) to show the new version number in the
  header and link to the correct version of the Google Drawing from the
  [OSBAPI Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B427Up4C9IE0VmM0ZlhHTG1Rc0E).
3. Open a new pull request titled **Release Proposal: v$major.$minor** from the
  branch of the fork to the master branch of the repository, with the following
  description:
  ```
  Announcing a new release candidate as described in the
  [Release Process](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-process).

  **Release version**: <v$major.$minor>
  **Release RC SHA**: <Release RC SHA>
  **Target release date**: <YYYY-MM-DD> (one week after the next weekly call)

  The one-week
  [Review Process](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#review-process)
  will be triggered on the next weekly call.
  ```
4. Announce the release proposal on the next weekly call and notify the mailing
  list of the proposal, triggering the start of the
  [Review Process](#review-process) as outlined below.

### Review Process

- All release proposals must be available for review for no less than one
  week before they are approved. This will provide each dedicated committer
  enough time to review the release proposal without unnecessarily delaying
  forward progress.
- Any dedicated committer can veto (via a "NOT LGTM" comment in the proposal).
  The comment must include the reasoning behind the veto. It is then expected
  that the dedicated committers will discuss the concerns and determine the next
  steps for release proposal. The submitter should either close/reject the
  proposal or address the concerns raised such that the "NOT LGTM" can be
  rescinded.
- A release proposal requires at least 3 "LGTM" comments from at least
  3 different organizations to be approved.

### Once Approved

Once the release is approved, the following actions should be taken by
any PMC member:

1. Merge the release proposal PR into the master branch of the repository. There
   should not be any conflicts as the text in the files that have changed should
   only be changed during this release process.
1. Checkout the **Release RC SHA** (either to a local branch or in 'detached HEAD'
   state). This is done in order to ensure that changes that were merged into
   master after the release candidate was created are not included in the
   release.
1. Cherry pick the `prepare release` commit.
1. Update [spec.md](spec.md), [profile](profile.md),
   [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml) and [swagger.yaml](swagger.yaml) to include the
   version of the release `v$major.$minor`.
1. Create a new commit with these changes called `finalise release`.
1. Tag the commit with the name `v$major.$minor`.
1. Push the tag to the repository with `git push origin v$major.$minor`.
1. Notify the mailing list of the new release.
1. Update the [Roadmap & Release Planning](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/projects/1)
   project.
1. The PMC will create a blog post for the new release.
