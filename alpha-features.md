## Overview

The features described in this document are released at an alpha level.  They
are are available for use in order for the community to provide feedback and
are not yet an official part of the spec.

Alpha features may be changed or removed in response to feedback in future
releases of the specification.  Alpha features will be changed only at release
boundaries.  The working group PMC will determine on a case-by-case basis
whether a particular change to the specification should be first release as an
alpha features.

At least one platform must implement a feature before it will be released as
alpha.

## How Alpha features are documented

In order to distinguish between alpha features, each alpha feature will be
documented separately within this document.  Every alpha feature must be
associated with an issue in the Open Service Broker API github repository and
must include a link to that issue in the text of this document.  Alpha
features must clearly state which portions of the API specification they
change and be documented at the level of quality and specificity expected from
any other API feature.

## Current Alpha features

There are currently no alpha features.
